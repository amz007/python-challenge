Syntax assistance was used from Chat GPT and Xpert Learning Assistant
PyPoll challenge - I struggled to get all candidates to print successfully, I used Xpert Learning Assistant and Chat GPT for code for the print statement to print all candidates. I understood how to run the calculations but I needed help with printing on one line for each candidate.
